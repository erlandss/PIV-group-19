# PIV-group-19


In this project you will implement a system that should accomplish two tasks:

- Given a template (one image) of a paper sheet, the system must detect the
template and correct its shape in a stream of images taken from a camera.
The camera can be static or can be moving around and the paper as well.

- Given a sequence of images of a board-like surface, the system must
combine all images into a single panoramic image.
